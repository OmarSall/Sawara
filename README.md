## Setting Up a Virtual Environment for the Project

To ensure a clean and isolated development environment, follow these steps to create and activate a virtual environment:

### 1️⃣ Install Python (if not already installed)
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You can check by running:
```python --version``` or ```python3 --version```

If Python is not installed, download and install it from the official Python website.
https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
In the project root directory, run:

•Windows:
```python -m venv venv```

•Mac/Linux:
```python3 -m venv venv```

This will create a folder named `venv` containing the virtual environment.

### 3️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment
•Windows (Command Prompt):
```venv\Scripts\activate```

•Windows (PowerShell):
```venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1```
*(If you get an error, run this command first: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process)*

•Mac/Linux (Terminal):
```source venv/bin/activate```

### 4️⃣ Install Dependencies
After activating the environment, install all necessary dependencies using:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
